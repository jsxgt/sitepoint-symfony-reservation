# Sitepoint - Symfony Reservation Form

**Requirements**

This app has the same [requirements](http://symfony.com/doc/current/reference/requirements.html) as a standard Symfony3 install.

The automated install script needs the following items.

* PHP interpreter that is accessible globally (is added in PATH)
* MySQL server
* Bash

**Installing**

**Please note** that the setup does not include any HTTP server settings, so you will need to set that up yourself. It also needs an existing database, so please create that before running it.

This repository includes everything needed to get an install with samples running.

This also has an install script for Linux and maybe Mac. For Windows users, refer to the setup.sh script and run the corresponding commands for Windows.

All you need to do is clone or download it to your hard drive, do a _chmod +x setup.sh_ and then run the setup with _./setup.sh_. It will prompt you for the database credentials, set the database schema and add samples.
